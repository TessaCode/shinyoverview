## Slides

* June 2022 - NMFS R UG - [Using Shiny for better science communication](presentations/shiny-slides-nmfsrug.html)
* March 2021 - FISH 497 at California State University, Northridge - Shiny apps (note: this presentation contains a lot of the same material as the NMFS R UG one, but references exercises)
  * [Part I: Build!](presentations/shiny-slides-497-part1.html)
  * [Part II: Deploy!](presentations/shiny-slides-497-part2.html)

## Setup

If you want to try out the app examples, install the following packages:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Basics
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra) # nice tables

# Shiny
library(shiny)
library(shinythemes) # bootstrap themes

# Interactive plots
library(plotly) 

# Making tutorials
library(learnr) # interactive tutorials
# remotes::install_github("rstudio-education/gradethis")
library(gradethis)

# Visualizing reactivity
library(reactlog)
```

This talk will introduce Shiny and its glorious abilities, with the assumption that you have heard of Shiny but haven't necessarily used it yet. Because there are tons of great examples online, I have highlighted tools that I have found useful and fun. The talk structure will be, more or less:

1. The building blocks: basic `shiny` functionality
2. Getting data into and out of `shiny`
3. Lessons I learned during the app development process

These latter two sections are optional but materials are included for you to explore on your own:

4. Translating `shiny` apps using `{shiny.18n}`
5. Shiny as a teaching tool using `{learnr}`
