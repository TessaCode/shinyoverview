# Marine science is like an orchestra

Each musician has areas where they’re very specialized, and areas where they are clueless

--

What we do is a combination of highly technical skilled work and more whimsical multitasking/communicating

--

But we’re all working together to try to make a big, beautiful thing happen

# How we deal with complexity in an orchestra setting: 

### Clean it up

### Use building blocks

### Streamline our communications

### People are the special ingredient

## <mark>This is the same in marine science! Shiny can help us with many of these tasks.</mark>

# Shiny basics

---

# What is Shiny?

![whatisshiny](img/whatisshiny.png)

---

# When is Shiny useful?

When we want to make R code accessible outside of an R or RStudio environment. For example,

--

- showing data visualizations to non-experts

--

- Teaching in an interactive way (e.g., `learnr`)

--

- Communicating model behavior or complex results in an interactive way (e.g., from large simulations)
  - Important! For a precautionary approach to management, need to communicate uncertainty and risk levels

---

# Starting a new Shiny app

Install **shiny**:

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
install.packages("shiny")
```

From The RStudio IDE, pick `New File -> Shiny Web App`

You can choose between single (**app.R**) or multiple files (**ui.R** and **server.R**)

*Does it matter which one you choose?*
>Not really. Some people like the organization of having multiple files. But it really doesn't make a difference!

>The experts are split on their preferences.

# Anatomy of a Shiny app

The **user interface (`ui`)** object dictates the appearance of the app. UI functions write HTML. For something to appear in your app, it needs to be in the UI.

***

The **`server()` function** contains rendering expressions that create the objects to display. 





The server function and UI object are passed to the `shinyApp()` function to create a Shiny app object.

---

# **ui.R**/server.R

.pull-left[
The ui looks like this:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
*            sliderInput("bins",
                        "Number of bins:",
                        min = 1,
                        max = 50,
                        value = 30)),
        mainPanel(
*           plotOutput("distPlot"))
    )
)
```
]

.pull-right[
The corresponding ui looks like this:

![basicui](img/basicui.png)
]

---

# **ui.R**/server.R

The ui code contains the following information: 

1. The UI type 
  - `fluidPage()` puts elements in rows that can include columns `r emo::ji("cake")`
  - `navbarPage()` has a navigation bar `r emo::ji("file")`

2. Layout elements (`sidebarLayout()` etc.)

3. Theme information (e.g., `{shinythemes}`)

--

4. Output objects (`plotOutput()`, etc.)

5. Input objects (`sliderInput()`,`fileInput()` etc.)

*Input objects link the user interface to the R code on the server.*

---

# ui.R/**server.R**

The server builds a list-like object called `output`. The contents of `output` are displayed in the ui.

```{r eval= FALSE}
server <- function(input, output) {
    output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
        # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
        x    <- faithful[, 2]
        bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)
        # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
        hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
    })
}
```

---

# **ui.R**/**server.R**

The server builds a list-like object called `output`. `output` objects are displayed in the ui. Here is how they are linked:

.pull-left[
```{r eval= FALSE}
server <- function(input, output) {
*    output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
        # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R
        x    <- faithful[, 2]
        bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)
        # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
        hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
    })
}
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
    titlePanel("Old Faithful Geyser Data"),
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            sliderInput("bins",
                        "Number of bins:",
                        min = 1,
                        max = 50,
                        value = 30)),
        mainPanel(
*           plotOutput("distPlot"))
    )
)
```

# What's on the server?

R code... mostly :)

--

![spirited](https://i.gifer.com/3QvT.gif)

---

# ui.R/**server.R**

- **Rendering functions** (`renderPlot()`, `renderTable()`, etc.)
  - Build a new object to display every time the inputs change

--

- **Reactive expressions**
  - `reactive()` caches reactive objects so you can access them later in the server logic -- very important!
  - `eventReactive()` creates reactive objects but only when a specific input changes (e.g., a "Run Analysis!" button is clicked)
  - lazy

--

- **Observe expressions** change the ui based on input, e.g.,
  - autopopulate default values in a form if a user has selected a default
  - change the range for one input based on another input
  - eager


---

# Shiny as mirror and window

- Building a Shiny app can teach you a lot about your own data and models
- Pilot testing can tell you about stakeholder needs and how to communicate your science more effectively (two-way street)

--

- Shiny as a ui can help users:
  - explore parameter space to understand sources of variation
  - explore model outputs to get an instinct for model behavior
  - look for details if and when they are ready

# Why I learned Shiny

![mmbiet](img/mmbiet.gif)

# UI development is a path to knowing our science and our audience more deeply

If you are designing an app for management, a good ui is essential.

--

Designing a good ui is hard! And Shiny defaults are not the most intuitive / appealing / accessible version they can be.

--

- my #1 tip: if you have time, pilot test with subject matter experts AND users
  - Define **user goals**
  - Use **missions** (e.g., "create a density plot of penguin weight")
  - For online-only pilot testing, apps like Maze and UsabilityHub can help you see how users are interacting with the interface
  
--

- check accessibility using the app's URL using the [Web Accessibility Evaluation (WAVE) Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/)

--

- use UX resources if they are available!

--
  
- if your institution doesn't have UX resources, design pilot testing so that you get helpful feedback on UX:
  - [18F Methods](https://methods.18f.gov/validate/) and [Maze](https://maze.design/guides/usability-testing/questions/) have great lists of testing questions and methods
  - 18F Methods also has an [example agreement](https://methods.18f.gov/participant-agreement/) for testers
  - Depending on the final format, places like  [UsabilityHub](https://usabilityhub.com/) have interfaces that will provide data on clicks and scrolling behavior when testing is remote

# You can publish Shiny apps!

If you've put a lot of time into making a Shiny app, you should get credit! 
The publication/credit avenues are unconventional for Shiny apps, but they DO exist.

- Publish as a package in an open source software journal (e.g., JOSS) (check out the `{golem}` pkg for structuring your files and streamlining production) `r emo::ji("package")`

- Publish code straight from GitHub with a DOI from Zenodo ( [here](https://www.rinproduction.com/en/posts/005-8-tips-for-a-production-ready-shiny-application/) are some good tips for preparing your app for production )

- (for "just for fun" apps): submit your Shiny app to the RStudio [Shiny contest](https://community.rstudio.com/t/shiny-contest-2020-is-here/51002)
<!-- see if you can get some data on citation rates for JOSS vs zenodo github entry -->

2. Runs on AWS architecture supported by Office of Science & Technology

3. License is limited to 100 users and applications can be public or private to only those with accounts

4. Looking to expand computing capabilities w/ license renewal this fall

5. Contact Christine Stawitz for more details
